## 🧠 Problem Statement

In the digital age, scams are evolving faster than ever. From WhatsApp job offers to fraudulent e-commerce websites, people are getting tricked daily — and there’s no public, open-source way for people to **warn** or **verify** such threats collaboratively.

## 🎯 Solution

A web-based platform where users can:

- 📤 **Report scams** with descriptions and evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)
- 👍👎 **Vote** on existing reports (scam or legit)
- 📜 **Browse scam reports** via an open “Scam Feed”
- 🔎 **Search** scams based on category or keyword
- 🔐 **Report anonymously** to maintain user privacy

All reports are stored securely and can be moderated by trusted users or admins.
