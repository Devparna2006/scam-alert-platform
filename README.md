A crowdsourced scam-reporting web app that helps users report, vote, and stay informed about online scams, frauds, and fake job offers.

## 🌐 Live Purpose

> “Scams are not stopping anytime soon, so let’s start spotting them—together.”

This project is built to:
- Let users **report suspicious messages, job offers, links, etc.**
- Allow the community to **vote** if it's really a scam or not
- Maintain a public **"Scam List"** so others can **verify before engaging**

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Workflow)

1. 🚀 **User visits the platform**
2. 📝 Fills a form to report a scam
3. 🧾 Submission gets added to the public "Scam List"
4. 👍👎 Other users vote on the report (Scam / Not Scam)
5. 🧠 Final result is based on community votes
6. 🔒 No login required (for now), reports are anonymous
